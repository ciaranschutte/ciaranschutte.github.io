For me, it's important to start something, even if it's a little derivative to begin with. Or the code isn't perfect. Waiting for the perfect time, or all the prerequisite knowledge will only lead to stasis. 

Aim for good enough. Iterate to perfection.

I've started a small project to get back into the swing of things. A basic app allowing a user to create a listing of show notes for a podcast. It's still a work in progress and there's already a list of improvements and features I still want to implement.

The app itself is Angular with Node/Mongo backend. The basic CRUD operations are supported and I delved into Node routing a little bit to stamp out some of my spaghetti code habits. 
<ul>
 <li>Gulp running just to compile SASS right now </li>
 <li>Xeditable for clean in place editing</li>
 <li>Angular UI Router for client side routing</li>
</ul>
A lot about Angular just works which is quite nice but for my own sanity I'll be delving into some Angular reading before I get back to this. Maybe then I can achieve slightly more idiomatic lines rather than

{% highlight html %}
<input typeahead="handle as handle for handle in handles | filter:$viewValue"..>
{% endhighlight %}

{% raw %}

{% endraw %}
